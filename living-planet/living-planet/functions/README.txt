This is the README file for my iOS application written in Swift

Due to the product's prototype nature, the application will be demonstrated using XCode's built in iPhone simulator at the VIVA

This is a simple process that will be explained at the VIVA

For the backend data handling, Firebase Authentication and Firestore Cloud were used - this means that, despite the application's prototype state, backend data and the authentication system can still be demonstrated - this will be shown and explained at the VIVA meeting

The VIVA will consist of a walkthrough of all of the application's features, allowing the markers to create their own accounts, create a plan, modify the plan, complete a 'Live Workout' session, add food to the database to see how this affects their calories, edit their goals, upload progress pictures and log out of the system, as well as the opportunity for questions

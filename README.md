# 'Living Planet' Web Solution Assignment Code

This is the code for one of my University assignments, where we had to create a web solution for a fictional charity called 'Living Planet'.

We had to display maps, using data from Google's Maps API, with relevant weather details, using data from the Open Weather API, depending on the location of the user-placed marker. We also had to set up Google Auth functionality that restricted access to a page that explained the process and how it works.

As per the assignment brief, this was written using PHP and jQuery

Please Note - The README file located in the main folder contains a link to the website (uploaded using Microsoft Azure) however this link may not work as the solution was uploaded using a University account with limited credits
